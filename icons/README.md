# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The recommended design:

- Simple, recognizable symbol (e.g., a speech bubble with "AC" or auto-complete symbol)
- GitHub's color scheme: #24292f for dark elements, #0969da for accent
- Clean, minimal design that works at small sizes
- Transparent background (PNG format)

## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files with these exact names. The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

## Icon Ideas

- Speech bubble with cursor/text
- Magnifying glass with code brackets
- Auto-complete dropdown symbol
- GitHub octocat with text suggestion
- Keyboard with suggestion popup
